This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Checking for the homogeneity of variance between categorical groups

require(stats)
require(graphics)
boxplot(weight~feed, data = chickwts, col = "lightgrey",
        main = "Chickweights Data",
        ylab = "Weight in grams",
        xlab = "Type of Feed")
```
```{r}
require(stats)
require(graphics)

names <- c(rep("1", 15), rep("2",80), rep("3", 7), rep("4", 36))
value <- c(sample(2:5, 15, replace=T), sample(4:10,80, replace=T), sample(1:7,7,replace=T), sample(3:9,36,replace=T))
data <- data.frame(names, value)
proportion <- table(data$names)/nrow(data)
boxplot(data$value ~ data$names, width=proportion,
        main="Width Relative to Group Size, n=15,80,7,36")

results <- aov(weight~feed, data=chickwts)
summary(results)

TukeyHSD(results, conf.level = 0.95)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
