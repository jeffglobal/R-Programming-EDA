This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)

backmtcars<-mtcars

gplot<-ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=wt))+
  geom_point()
gplot

plot(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)

mpg_model <- lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)
summary(mpg_model)

plot(mpg_model, which = 1:6)

qt(0.975, df=28)    # Hypothesis testing (T distribution) 30 minus 2df for what? 2 sided test?
                    # Reject null hypothesis that slope is zero.
                    
pt(-9.559, df=28)   # Hypothesis testing on P values (T distribution)
                    # Reject null hypothesis that slope is zero. (sic) not dup...

hist(mpg_model$residuals)
qqnorm(mpg_model$residuals)
qqline(mpg_model$residuals)
shapiro.test(mpg_model$residuals)

# My additions to normality testing, H0=It is normal, reject if p>0.05:



ks.test(mpg_model$residuals, "pnorm", mean=mean(mpg_model$residuals), sd=sd(mpg_model$residuals)) # One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

nortest::ad.test(mpg_model$residuals) # Anderson-Darling normality test

fBasics::dagoTest(mpg_model$residuals)    # D'Agostino Normality test NOT effected if data has identical values
                                          # Chi2 can only be used on categorical variable(s), need to bin the data prior to use otherwise.
                                          # Sample size > 5, and Data is randomly sampled.

# Look for lilliefors test...

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
